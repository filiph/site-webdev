As you have completed the milestones, the application has naturally gotten larger.
As you continue to build out feature areas, the overall application size will get larger also.
At some point you'll reach a tipping point where the application takes long time to load.

How do you combat this problem?  With asynchronous routing which loads feature modules _lazily_, on request.
Lazy loading has multiple benefits.

- You can load feature areas only when requested by the user.
- You can speed up load time for users that only visit certain areas of the application.
- You can continue expanding lazy-loaded feature areas without increasing the size of the initial load bundle.
