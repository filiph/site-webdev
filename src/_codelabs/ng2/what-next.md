<p class="lead">Congratulations!</p>

You've written an AngularDart web app!

Now that you've written your app, what do you do next?
Here are some suggestions.

## <i class="fa fa-anchor"> </i> Try the next Angular codelab.

<div class="trydart-step-details" markdown="1">
The [AngularDart Components codelab](/codelabs/angular_components)
introduces you to a preview release of AngularDart Components,
part of a large group of well-tested components that
are widely used in Googleâ€™s Dart apps.
</div>

## <i class="fa fa-anchor"> </i> Read the guides.

<div class="trydart-step-details" markdown="1">
Work through the [AngularDart developer guide](/angular/guide).
</div>


## <i class="fa fa-anchor"> </i> Read the tutorials.

<div class="trydart-step-details" markdown="1">
Learn more about Dart from
the [web tutorials](/tutorials).
</div>


## <i class="fa fa-anchor"> </i> Build your app to run in any browser.

<div class="row"> <div class="col-md-7" markdown="1">

<div class="trydart-step-details" markdown="1">
You can test your app in other browsers by right-clicking
index.html and choosing **Open in Browser** from the pop up menu.

To compile the app into JavaScript that runs in any modern browser,
use **pub build**.  Build the app in WebStorm, as follows:

<ol markdown="1">
<li markdown="1">Open `pubspec.yaml` and click **Build...**.
</li>

<li markdown="1">From the dialog,
choose **Release** or **Debug**, as desired.
The third option allows you to
[specify a mode](/tools/pub/pub-build#options)
to `pub build`.
</li>
</ol>

</div>

</div> <div class="col-md-5" markdown="1">

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o key-header"> </i> <strong> Not using WebStorm? </strong>

* To compile a deployable version of your app from the command line,
  use the [pub build](/tools/pub/pub-build) command.
